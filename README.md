<h3 align="center">Amplification + AWS Lambda Adapter</h3>

  <p align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter">AWS Lambda Adapter</a> is the best kept secret that you can use in order to migrate non-lambda native application to the Lambda world. 
    The following repo shows an example of using a Nest based application created with <a href="https://amplication.com">Amplication</a> which is connected to a RDS database and exposed
    to the outside world using Lambda URL and a Lambda Web Adapter.

## High level architecture

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/amplication.png" alt="Architecture diagram">
</div>

1. A NestJS application created with the Amplication development tool. 
2. The application runs inside a Lambda using a docker image created by Amplication.
3. The Lambda is connected to the outside world using Lambda URL functionality.
4. And it's located inside a private subnet with an access to an RDS database.


## Getting started
### Prerequisites
* Make sure your machine is ready to work with [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)

### Installation
* Clone this repository.
* Run `sam build` and then `sam deploy --guided`.
* Choose user name and password for the DB.
* Make sure you a key pair for the bastion station.
* The Lambda URL has no authentication on purpose, the authentication is being handled by NestJS.

### Testing
* Access the Lambda URL end point and append `/api`, for example `https://****.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/api`. 
* Authorize using `admin` as user and password, and make a call.

## Landmarks
* Defining the extension to be part of your docker file - https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/web-adapter-example/blob/f787c8c8689259132db70b48b817da16217a5b7b/server/Dockerfile#L28
* NestJS application runs on port 8080 - https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/web-adapter-example/blob/f787c8c8689259132db70b48b817da16217a5b7b/server/template.yaml#L206
* Authentication handled by NestJS - https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/web-adapter-example/blob/f787c8c8689259132db70b48b817da16217a5b7b/server/template.yaml#L210
* Initial DB migration - https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/web-adapter-example/blob/f787c8c8689259132db70b48b817da16217a5b7b/server/template.yaml#L125
* Using secret manager to save credentials - https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/web-adapter-example/blob/f787c8c8689259132db70b48b817da16217a5b7b/server/template.yaml#L164
* **Anti Pattern** Embedding the credentials as part of UserData, this solution is quick and dirty use SecretsManager - https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/web-adapter-example/blob/f787c8c8689259132db70b48b817da16217a5b7b/server/template.yaml#L124
